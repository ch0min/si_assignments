Task 3
Using your Server and Client console applications create an extra
service – one version mirrors the string but reverses it and one
mirrors it but removes all white space. Your message should be
received by your refactored server service which then passes the
message to the new string mirroring ‘service’.

So you now have an application that passes a message and it needs
to contain both the message and the action to be taken (reverse or
remove white space). Your server code needs to handle the message
and return the appropriate result

Think about the different ways you could solve this problem. What
ideas first cam to mind? What are the challenges here.

This can be done in a language of your choice
